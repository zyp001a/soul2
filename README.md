Soul2 is a self-generated language, which is designed to be used to translate into any programming language.

Use './checkreset' to build, the final product is 'seed.go', it must be placed at the same with 'get-stdin.js'(copy from sindresorhus/get-stdin), 'progl-parser.js', 'tpl-parser.js', 'sl-reader', 'db'(a dir).

Use './check' to test internal function

Use './check all golang' to test GO language generation. After this a bin 'soul3' is generated. 

Use './checkmid' to do self-generation. ('main.sl.exec/golang/main.go' is generated by running itself')

Read 'CHECKLIST.newlang' to implement the generation of other language (only GO language is implemented now)
